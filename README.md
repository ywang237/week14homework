# Unit 14 | Assignment - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... Our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](Data/data.js). We also need to allow our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... We only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... Right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Your Task

* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Add an `input` tag to your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.


### Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Completion of all steps in chosen level

* Visual attraction

* Usability

**Good luck!**
